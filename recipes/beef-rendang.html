      <h1>Rendang</h1>
      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>
        Rendang is a rich and tender Indonesian slow-cooked dry curry
        originating from the Minangkabau ethnic group of West Sumatra. This
        iconic dish is made by simmering beef with coconut milk and a fragrant
        blend of spices including lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric,
        ginger, and chili, until the liquid reduces and the meat becomes deeply
        caramelized and infused with intense flavor. Traditionally served during
        ceremonial occasions and festive gatherings, rendang is known not only
        for its complex taste—spicy, savory, and slightly sweet—but also for its
        long shelf life due to the cooking technique. Recognized globally,
        rendang was once voted the “World’s Most Delicious Food” by CNN
        International’s readers. Its texture is dry and rich, with the beef
        incredibly soft from hours of slow cooking. Rendang is often enjoyed
        with steamed rice and complements other Indonesian dishes beautifully.

      <h2>Ingrdients:</h2>
      <h3>Main:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) beef (chuck or shank), cut into large cubes</li>
        <li>400 ml (1 can) coconut milk (preferably thick, unsweetened)</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 stalks lemongrass, smashed</li>
        <li>4 kaffir lime leaves, torn</li>
        <li>2 turmeric leaves (optional), tied into a knot</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tamarind juice or 1 tbsp tamarind paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 tbsp cooking oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Spice for The Paste:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 shallots</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>5 red chilies (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>3 candlenuts (or substitute with macadamia nuts)</li>
        <li>2 cm fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 cm fresh galangal</li>
        <li>2 cm fresh turmeric (or 1 tsp turmeric powder)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4><li>Prepare the Spice Paste</li></h4>
        <p>
          Blend all spice paste ingredients into a smooth paste. You can add a
          little oil or water if needed.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Sauté the Paste</li></h4>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a large wok or pot over medium heat. Sauté the spice paste
          until fragrant, about 5-7 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Add Aromatics</li></h4>
        <p>
          Add lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and turmeric leaves (if using).
          Stir for 1–2 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Add Beef</li></h4>
        <p>
          Add beef cubes and cook until all surfaces are browned and well coated
          with the spices.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Pour in Liquids</li></h4>
        <p>
          Add coconut milk and water. Stir gently. Add tamarind juice, sugar,
          and salt. Bring to a boil.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Simmer Slowly</li></h4>
        <p>
          Reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered for 3–4 hours, stirring
          occasionally to prevent burning. Cook until the liquid has evaporated
          and the meat is tender and dark brown.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Final Caramelization</li></h4>
        <p>
          As the dish dries out, oil will separate. Stir often so the beef
          caramelizes in the coconut oil and darkens in color.
