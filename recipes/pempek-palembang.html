    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Pempek Palembang is a traditional Indonesian savory fish cake delicacy
      originating from Palembang, South Sumatra. It is made primarily from
      ground fish (commonly tenggiri or mackerel) mixed with tapioca flour,
      giving it a chewy and bouncy texture. What makes Pempek unique is its
      variety of shapes and fillings, the most famous being Pempek Kapal Selam
      (submarine Pempek), which is stuffed with a whole egg. Other types include
      Pempek Lenjer (long cylindrical shape), Pempek Adaan (fried round balls),
      and Pempek Kulit (made with fish skin). Pempek is served with a dark,
      rich, sweet-sour and spicy sauce called Cuko, made from palm sugar,
      tamarind, garlic, and chili. It’s typically enjoyed as a snack or light
      meal and represents one of the most iconic culinary treasures of
      Indonesia.

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4>Making Pempek:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix the minced fish with salt, sugar, and water. Stir until
        smooth and sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add tapioca flour while kneading lightly until it becomes a
        smooth dough. Do not over-knead.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Pempek Lenjer: take a portion of dough and shape it into long
        cylinders.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Pempek Kapal Selam: take a ball of dough, flatten it, fill with a
        piece of boiled egg, then seal and shape like a submarine.
      </li>
      <li>Boil water in a large pot. Add a bit of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>
        Boil the pempek until they float (about 10–15 minutes), then remove and
        let them cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can deep-fry the boiled pempek before serving for a crispy texture
        (optional but traditional).
      </li>

      <li>Blend garlic and chilies, then add to the boiling sauce.</li>
      <li>
        Simmer for 10–15 minutes until fragrant. Strain the sauce for a smooth
        finish.
      </li>
